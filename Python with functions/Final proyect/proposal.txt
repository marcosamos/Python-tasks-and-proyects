Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Learn to read in spanish

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    My program is address at parents who teach their children to read and need a simple interface for their children.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    I learned that a simple idea is more complex when wrote into a program but,
     its satisfaction when I realized that I learned a lot of concepts during the class because I can apply my knowledge.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
    I use tkinter and random, pytest.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes
6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
    Currently no, I am building the program still, I am working on the functions.
